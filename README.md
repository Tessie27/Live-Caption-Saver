# Live-Caption-Saver
Live Caption Saver is a lightweight Windows app that captures real-time text from the built-in Windows Live Captions feature using advanced OCR. It automatically detects the caption window, extracts and timestamps spoken dialogue, and saves it into a readable .txt file â€” perfect for accessibility, transcription, meetings, or personal note-taking.
